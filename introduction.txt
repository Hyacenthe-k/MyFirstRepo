# Brief Introduction About Myself
My name is Karinda Hyacenthe. I am a passionate tech learner from Rwanda, currently diving deep into computer networking and software engineering. I believe in using technology to solve real community problems and uplift others.
I enjoy helping people, especially teaching them about digital tools. I dream of building a tech career that empowers rural communities in Africa. Outside tech, I love football and working on community development projects.
